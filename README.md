# The Useless Web

That is our first individual JavaScript assignment. The purpose was to create a small application or website which serves no purpose but still makes the user intrigued. The application should be created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here below Iâ€™m providing more information about this project:

-   Application will be in demo mode and will be rate-limited to 50 requests per hour. Read more here: https://unsplash.com/documentation
-   Responsive design for mobile, tablet and desktop.
-   It's possible to hover on each picture and see the number of likes for each picture. Observe that this only applies to desktops. Sometimes you need to wait about one second to be able to see this information. See the picture below:
<div align="center">
    <img src="./images/likes.png" width="400px"</img> 
</div>

-   I've enabled a loading gif while images are loading.
-   The number of uploaded images on load changes depending on the screen type (mobile, tablet, and desktop).
-   You can change the background color of the header when you click on it.
-   Website URL: https://the-useless-web.netlify.app/
