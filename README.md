# The Useless Web

That is our first individual JavaScript assignment. The purpose was to create a small application or website which serves no purpose but still makes the user intrigued. The application should be created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here below Iâ€™m providing more information about this project:

-   Application will be in demo mode and will be rate-limited to 50 requests per hour. Read more here: https://unsplash.com/documentation
-   Responsive design for mobile, tablet and desktop
-   It's possible to hover on each picture and see the number of likes for each picture. This only applies to desktops. See the picture below:
<div align="center">
    <img src="./images/likes.png" width="400px"</img> 
</div>
-   I've enabled a loading gif while images are loading
-   The number of uploaded images changes depending on the screen type (mobile, tablet, desktop).
-   You can change the background color of the header when you click on it.
